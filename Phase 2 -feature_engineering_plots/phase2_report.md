# Phase 2: Feature Engineering Analysis Report

## Data Overview
The feature engineering phase focused on transforming and enhancing raw data into meaningful features, as evidenced by the following datasets:
- Account Metrics (account_metrics.csv)
- Merged Trader Sentiment (merged_trader_sentiment.csv)
- Engineered Sentiment Data (sentiment_data_engineered.csv)
- Engineered Trader Data (trader_data_engineered.csv)

## Key Features Generated
1. Trader Sentiment Analysis:
   - Sentiment data has been engineered to capture market mood indicators
   - Merged trader sentiment provides a comprehensive view of market participants' behavior

2. Account Performance Metrics:
   - Trading activity patterns
   - Account-level performance indicators
   - Risk metrics derived from trading behavior

## Conclusions
- The feature engineering process has successfully transformed raw data into analytically useful features
- Created a rich set of derived variables for subsequent analysis phases
- Established foundation for advanced analytics by combining sentiment and trading metrics

## Next Steps
- These engineered features will be used in exploratory data analysis
- Will serve as inputs for statistical analysis and modeling phases
- Forms the basis for pattern recognition in trading behavior
