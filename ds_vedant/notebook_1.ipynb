    "Suggested mapping (existing files in repo):\n",
    "- `1_data_preparation_eda.ipynb` -> detailed EDA and preparation\n",
    "- `code.ipynb` -> helper code snippets (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to open in Colab:\n",
    "1. Upload this repository to GitHub or ensure the files are accessible via raw URLs.\n",
    "2. In Colab: File -> Open notebook -> GitHub, then paste the repo URL and pick the notebook file (for example `1_data_preparation_eda.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like, run the `organize_files.py` script from the repository root to copy the real notebooks into this folder as `notebook_1.ipynb` (preserves originals by default). See `../README.md` for usage.\n"
